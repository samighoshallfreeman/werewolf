* Initialize list of coordinates to check for obstructions

* 1,1 on the grid is the center of the game grid at [1][1]
* Step along f(x), increasing by one until you hit the destination x
	* For all possible fuzzy ys (ys between enemy and player):
		* Check distance between grid center at possible_fuzzy_y, x
			* Do this by checking the intersection between the sight line and f(x) = possible_fuzzy_y
		* if the distance < 0.3 (or whatever), include it in our list of grid spots to check for obstructions
* If no obstructions in list of coordinates, return true!
* Else, false
